7. Login to your [https://www.resideo.com](https://account.honeywellhome.com).
8. Click Allow
9. Select Devices
   - I would recommend selecting all devices since you can restrict the devices you don't want in the Home app later, by DeviceID.

11. Click Save
    - If you plan on adding this plugin into a child bridge, I would configure that at this time before restarting Homebridge.
      - Reminder that you will have to add this child bridge into the home app to get Resideo accessories to show up.
12. Restart Homebridge
